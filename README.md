# Memory Allocator

Creating a custom memory allocator API using C as a practice 

**STATUS :** *WIP*

## Requirements

*cmake* Version >= 3.0

## Setup

-create a build directory and cd to it for generating build files :
```
mkdir build && cd build
```

-generate build files using cmake :
```
cmake ..
```
-build the project with make:

```
make
```
**NOTE:** As per now the project produces a binary for future development cycles
it will provide a static library to use in other projects

You should now have the built binary under bin/MemoryAllocator at the root of this project
